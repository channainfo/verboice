      container_second_title: "How does it work?"
      container_second_desc: "To get started, first set up a phone number dedicated to Verboice. Next, record outgoing messages offline, for later upload, or directly, using the Verboice Web application. Once you've recorded your outgoing messages, create your program's navigation sequence using Verboice's easy-to-use tools and review it using the onscreen flowchart. Community members can then access your interactive program from any phone. The caller will hear your audio file, which will usually ask them a question, respond either by voice or keypad entry and then hear the next audio file that you’ve specified to play based on the caller’s response to the previous question.  Responses are collected automatically, and you can log into your Verboice account to review them at your convenience."

      container_third_panel_second_desc: "InSTEDD designed, developed, and pilot tested a tool (Watchfire) to help the American Red Cross (ARC) improve their community- level disaster response in the San Francisco Bay Area. After working closely with the ARC on a needs assessment, we learned that their highest priority was improving the speed and coordination of ARC's Disaster Action Teams (DATs). Watchfire makes phone calls and sends SMS text messages to volunteers to ask them if they can respond to an emergency and provides these potential responders with sufficient information to arrive at the event site."
