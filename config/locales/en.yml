When abuses are noted, human rights organizations can use Verboice to point the way toward supportive/protective resources, supply legal information, and give the most oppressed a voice that carries beyond the confines of their communities."

Using Verboice, first responders quickly get a firsthand look at the conditions in even widely separated communities, without having to spend precious time travelling from place to place. Triage efforts are based on voice reports gathered directly from victims, helping disaster response teams to better deal with often rapidly changing circumstances and deliver the best care possible."

To keep everyone on track, activists can share ideas about priorities and new initiatives from any cellular or landline-based phone. Whatever the cause, Verboice makes change just a little easier to achieve."

      container_second_desc: "To get started, first set up a phone number dedicated to Verboice. Next, record outgoing messages offline, for later upload, or directly, using the Verboice Web application. Once you've recorded your outgoing messages, create your program's navigation sequence using Verboice's easy-to-use tools and review it using the onscreen flowchart. Community members can then access your interactive program from any phone. The caller will hear your audio file, which will usually ask them a question, respond either by voice or keypad entry and then hear the next audio file that you’ve specified to play based on the caller’s response to the previous question.  Responses are collected automatically, and you can log into your Verboice account to review them at your convenience."

After working closely with the ARC on a needs assessment, we learned that their highest priority was improving the speed and coordination of ARC's Disaster Action Teams (DATs). Watchfire makes phone calls and sends SMS text messages to volunteers to ask them if they can respond to an emergency and provides these potential responders with sufficient information to arrive at the event site."
